# ELEVATE ANIMATION ASSIGNMENT

The animation on the page runs immediately on page reload. It is only a one time animation and to retrigger the animation 
you can either refresh the page or click the "Replay" button on the screen.

To get the project up and running in your environment:

1. Clone the repository in your local machine
2. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies required to run the project smoothly.
3. Now run `npm run dev` and you will be able to access the animation on http://localhost:5173/
